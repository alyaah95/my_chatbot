A Brief Overview of Egypt's History: From the Pharaohs to a Beacon of Islamic Civilization
Introduction
Egypt's history is one of the longest and most magnificent in the world. Often called the "Cradle of Civilization," its contributions to art, science, governance, and religion have shaped human history. This document highlights key periods, with a special focus on the blessed Islamic Conquest of Egypt, a pivotal event that marked the beginning of a brilliant new chapter for the land of the Nile.

1. Ancient Egypt: The Era of the Pharaohs (c. 3100 BCE – 30 BCE)
Major Contributions: The ancient Egyptians built a great civilization renowned for its monumental architecture—the Pyramids of Giza, the Sphinx, and vast temples. They developed hieroglyphic writing and made advances in medicine, astronomy, and engineering.

Key Dynasties: The Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms were ruled by powerful pharaohs like Khufu, Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Akhenaten, and Ramses II.

End of an Era: Egypt fell under successive foreign rules: the Persians, then the Greeks under Alexander the Great, and finally the Romans, marking the end of the Pharaonic era.

2. Greco-Roman and Byzantine Rule (332 BCE – 641 CE)
Ptolemaic Dynasty: Founded by one of Alexander's generals, this Greek-speaking dynasty ruled from Alexandria. The famous Queen Cleopatra VII was the last Ptolemaic ruler.

Roman & Byzantine Province: After Rome annexed Egypt, it became a vital breadbasket for the empire. With the division of the Roman Empire, Egypt became a core province of the Byzantine Empire, which exerted control and had a tense relationship with the native Egyptian population.

3. The Glorious Islamic Conquest of Egypt (639–641 CE)
This event is regarded in Islamic and historical consciousness as a manifest conquest that brought freedom, justice, and faith to the land of Egypt, liberating it from oppressive Byzantine rule.

The Hero: ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (RA): A wise and renowned companion of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), chosen by the Rightly Guided Caliph ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (RA) to lead the conquest armies.

The Context: The Egyptian people had suffered under Byzantine rule from injustice, heavy taxation, and persecution, which led them to welcome the Muslim conquerors as liberators.

Treatment with Mercy: The Muslim armies adhered to the teachings of Islam regarding mercy and justice. They offered the Egyptian people fair choices: to embrace Islam, to retain their religion while paying the Jizyah (tax) in return for state protection, or to fight.

The Liberation of Babylon Fortress & Foundation of Fustat: The Babylon Fortress was liberated, and ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (RA) established the city of Fustat as the new capital of Islamic Egypt, beginning a new chapter from there.

Fulfillment of a Prophecy: This conquest is seen as the fulfillment of the prophecy of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), who said, “You shall conquer Egypt—a land where the qirat [a unit of measure] is used. So when you conquer it, treat its people well, for they have protection and ties of kinship.” (Sahih Muslim). The conquest ended centuries of injustice and established an era of justice and prosperity under Islamic rule.

4. Egypt Under Islamic Rule
Egypt became a beating heart of the Islamic world and the capital of great Islamic states that maintained the country's Sunni identity.

Umayyad and Abbasid Eras: Egypt became a prosperous province under the Islamic Caliphate.

The Fatimid Rule (969–1171 CE): A two-century period of Shi'a rule, during which the city of Cairo (Al-Qahira) was founded and Al-Azhar University was established, which later transformed into the world's foremost stronghold of Sunni scholarship.

The Return of Sunni Rule: The Ayyubid Dynasty (1171–1250 CE): Led by Salahuddin al-Ayyubi (Saladin), who liberated Egypt and restored Sunni rule, freed Jerusalem from the Crusaders, and unified Islamic efforts.

The Mamluk Sultanate (1250–1517 CE): They defended the Islamic world by repelling the Mongol invasion at the Battle of Ain Jalut (1260) and left a great architectural legacy in Cairo.

5. The Ottoman Era and the Muhammad Ali Dynasty (1517 – 1952)
Ottoman Province: Egypt became part of the Ottoman Empire while maintaining its distinct entity.

The Muhammad Ali Dynasty (1805 – 1952): Began with Muhammad Ali Pasha, who founded modern Egypt. This era witnessed a major renaissance in industry, agriculture, and education, building the foundations of the modern Egyptian state. Egypt was a stable monarchy under the rule of Muhammad Ali's dynasty, which worked to develop the country and enhance its sovereignty, until this era was ended.

Conclusion
Egypt's history is a rich legacy of successive civilizations, and the Islamic Conquest was the most important milestone that shaped its Arab-Islamic identity. Egypt witnessed periods of prosperity under the umbrella of the Islamic Caliphate and then during its independent royal era, which built a modern state and established solid institutions, before later transformations changed its course. Egypt remains the "Mother of the World," preserving its faith and ancient heritage.
